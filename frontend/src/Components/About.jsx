        <h1>About PulseConnect 🩸</h1>
        <p>
          We started PulseConnect with one mission — make it effortless
          for people to donate blood and organs, and for those in need
          to find a match quickly and safely.
        </p>

            <h2 className="section-heading">Why PulseConnect Exists</h2>
            <p className="section-text">
              Every year, thousands of people in India die because they
              cannot find a matching blood or organ donor in time.
              PulseConnect was created to bridge that gap — connecting
              willing donors with patients who urgently need help.
              <br /><br />
              We believe technology can save lives. Our platform makes
              it simple to register as a donor, get verified, and be
              notified when someone nearby needs you.

            <h3>🎯 Our Goal</h3>
            <p>
              To build India's largest, most trusted network of blood
              and organ donors — where every registered user can
              potentially save a life with a single click.
              <br /><br />
              We aim to cover all major Indian cities and make same-day
              donor matching a reality for hospitals and patients.
